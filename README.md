# Personal Apache Sites

This is a repo for the Apache site configs for my personal sites and
side-projects; a way to track the VirtualHosts and SSL configs in Git.

I use an rsync script to sync tracked files to the server so updating
the configs is even easier than SSHing in and editing them on the server.
